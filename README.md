# sqlite-deploy

Build, test and deploy scripts for [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/), for CODE-RADE

# Dependencies

  * [readline](https://ci.sagrid.ac.za/job/readline-deploy/)
  * [Tcl/Tk](https://ci.sagrid.ac.za/job/tcltk-deploy/)

# Downstream

Several CODE-RADE applications are configured to link against SQlite, notably Python and ROOT.

# Versions

Versions built by CODE-RADE :

  1. 3.9.2
  1. ~~3.16.2~~
  2. ~~3.18.00~~

At present, only the 3.9.2 release is compiled, due to the strange source directory structure of  sqlite.
